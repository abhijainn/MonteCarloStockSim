# MonteCarloStockSim
This project implements a Monte Carlo Stock Simulation to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The simulation uses random sampling from a normal distribution to model the variability in stock returns. Additionally, the Cholesky decomposition is applied to the covariance matrix to introduce correlations between stock returns.
